# Empirical study of SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and its impact

This is a small data analysis project with the aim to make sense of existing
data and see underlying patterns:
* We do not do fancy epidemiological modelling just basic data analysis.
* We use publicly available data collected from many sources.
* Our main aim is to get easily understandable visualisations.

You are free to use the code and data as long as acknowledge that it is a hobby
project. You should not make life changing decisions based on it alone.
